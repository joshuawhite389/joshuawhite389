## Hi, my name is Josh!
I'm currently a Sofware Developer Associate at PNC Bank
where I spend much of my time testing new features
developed for the group I'm aligned to. Looking for bugs is fun,
but I also have a passion for making them ðŸ˜„. I'll be adding
more projects to my projects repository as I continue to hone my
skills and learn new things.  More to follow!
